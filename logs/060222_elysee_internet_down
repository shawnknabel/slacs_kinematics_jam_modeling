Half-light radius from MGE
- I used Michele's relation of L(R) = Sum_k <<< L_k  [ 1 - exp(-R^2/2sig_k^2) ] >>> 
- Then L/2 = Sum_k <<< L_k  [ 1 - exp(-R_eff^2/2sig_k^2) ] >>>
- Calculate L(R) for range of R in arcseconds, take L(R) - L/2 and find the root after interpolation... That's R_eff

mge_fit_sectors_regularized
- Iterates many times to find the best version (with constraints on inclination) -- I don't get this
- Implemented this directly after the half-light from the non-regularized model to see how it might change
    - Changed from R_eff = 1.195 to 1.160
- Made everything significantly simpler and rounder

JAM fitting
- Fit looks good, but the photometric major axis appears to be aligned with the kinematics, which isn't the case
- I checked through the jampy code, and it appears that it assumes alignment... so now what?
